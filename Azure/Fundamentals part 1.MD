High level - How does Azure work?
- Virtualization
    - hypervisor
each data center has many servers
each server includes hypervisor
Network switch provides connections to all the servers
1 server in each rack runs a piece of software called the "Fabric controller"
Each "Fabric controller" is connected to a piece of software called the "orchestrator"
The "orchestrator" is responsible for everything that happens in Azure, including responding to users
Users make request to the "orchestrator" via the web api
the Web api can be called by many tools, including the web interface of the azure portal
When a user wants a VM, the request is sent to the orchestrator, the orchestrator picks the best server rack, the fabric controller creates the VM

What is the Azure Marketplace?
Azure marketplace helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors ans startups that are offering their solution ans services, which are optimized to run on Azure.
